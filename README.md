## What Is This?

The concept of a Dashboard appears nearly everywhere. Most obvious are car dashboards with displays of speed, mileage, and navigation. Less obvious examples are: the FaceBook banner with notifications, informational displays in lobbies, and “widgets” on iOS and Android. A portion of a larger display is a widget.
